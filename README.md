# 3d-lab

This is my personal lab for Web 3D development. It is split into four categories:

- Collect: Resources, Collections, Libraries, Websites - Everything I collect and find useful for my 3D projects
- Use: Small prototypes and experiments
- Note: Documentation and Thoughts on projects and possible improvements
- Teach: For improved understanding and sharing knowledge

## Structure

- `collect/`
  - [resources](collect/resources.md)
  - [libraries](collect/libraries.md)
  - [websites](collect/websites.md)
- `use/`
  - [prototypes overview](use/prototypes.md)
- `note/`
  - [documentation overview](note/thoughts.md)
- `teach/`

- `src/`: for if this should become a website, this is where the code will be stored

## TODO

- See `todo.md` as the working checklist.
